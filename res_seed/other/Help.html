        <h2><a name="search"></a>Searching the Volumes</h2>
        <h4>Choose what to search for</h4>
        <p>
            Type the words you wish to search for in the text box. The search engine is case insensitive i.e. searching for 'heavenly' will find all occurrences of 'heavenly', 'Heavenly' or 'HEAVENLY'. Any punctuation that you enter will be ignored (except for possessive apostrophes &amp; hyphens).
        </p>
        <h4>Select the type of search from the 'Search Type' menu</h4>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Exact Match</strong> - will find sentences (or verses if searching the Bible) where the words occur consecutively, in the order in which you have typed them.</li>
                <li><strong>Sentence contains words in order</strong> - will find sentences (or verses if searching the Bible) in which <u>all</u> of the words occur in the order you typed them although not necessarily consecutively.</li>
                <li><strong>Sentence contains words</strong> - will find sentences (or verses if searching the Bible) in which <u>all</u> of the words occur in any order and not necessarily consecutively.</li>
                <li><strong>Paragraph contains words</strong> - will find paragraphs (or chapters if searching the Bible) in which <u>all</u> of the words occur in any order and not necessarily consecutively.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Choose authors to search</h4>
        <p>
            From the rows of check boxes choose whether you wish to search the Bible, Hymns or volumes of ministry. You can search more than one of them at once. Clicking the 'All' button (when one or more of the check boxes are selected) will check all the boxes, clicking 'All' again (when all the check boxes are selected) will uncheck all the boxes.
        </p>
        <h4>Click search</h4>
        <p>
            Finally, click the 'Search' button and then, after a short time (depending on the speed of your computer), the search results page will be displayed. The first search of a particular author will be slower than subsequent searches for the same author since the index needs to be loaded in the first search.
        </p>
        <h4>Choose your result</h4>
        <p>
            Clicking on one of the references on the search results page will take you to that reference. The matched sentence/paragraph will be displayed at the top of your browser window.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Wildcards</h3>
        <p>
            If you search for 'delight*' then the search engine will find all sentences that contain <u>one or more</u> of the following words: delight, delights, delightful, delighted and delighting. Likewise, if you search for '*boat' then the search engine will find all sentences that contain <u>one or more</u> of the following words: life-boat, boat, lifeboat, pleasure-boat and church-boat. Finally, if you search for '*wait*' then the search engine will find all sentences that contain <u>one or more</u> of the following words: wait, waited, waiting, waits, awaits, waiteth, awaiting, await, awaited and waiter.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wildcard searches take considerably longer than normal searches and the type of search selected in the 'Search Type' menu will be ignored.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Refining searches</h3>
        <p>
            When you have completed at least one search, the Refine button will be enabled. This allows you to search the results of the previous search.
        </p>
        <h4>Refine including</h4>
        <p>
            To refine the results to include a search term, type the search term and click refine
            <br> For example, search for the phrase "corn of wheat", close the results window, enter "contact with men" in the search string field and then click the Refine button. A reference in JBS volume 7 will be found.
        </p>
        <h4>Refine excluding</h4>
        <p>
            To refine the results to exclude a search term, prefix the search term you wish to exclude with an '!'
            <br> For example for the phrase "corn of wheat" again but this time enter "!die" in the search string field before clicking the Refine button. This time the search engine will find all sentences that contain "corn of wheat", but don't contain "die".
        </p>
        <p>The results of a refined search can be further refined.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Very Frequent Words</h3>
        <p>
            There are a number of words (about 200) that occur so frequently (more than 1000 times) in ministry that they have not been indexed (for example: 'a', 'all', 'am', 'and', 'any' and 'are'). If these are the only words that you enter in the search string then the search engine will return no matches.
        </p>
        <hr>
