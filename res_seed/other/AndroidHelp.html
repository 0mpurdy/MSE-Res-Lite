            <h2>Reading the Volumes</h2>
            <p>
                To read a volume:
                <ul>
                    <li>Open the menu (click the menu button in the top left or scroll in from the left)</li>
                    <li>Click "Library"</li>
                    <li>Click the author you wish to read</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                All Scripture references are underlined (hyperlinks), and clicking the reference will take you to the appropriate chapter/verse in the J.N.D. and Authorized (parallel) versions of the Bible.
            </p>
            <p>
                Clicking the "go to synopsis" link at the start of a chapter in the Bible will take you to the relevant page of J.N.D.'s Synopsis.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="left-aligned">
            <h2><a name="search"></a>Searching the Volumes</h2>
            <p>
                Type the words you wish to search for in the text box. The search engine is case insensitive i.e. searching for 'heavenly' will find all occurrences of 'heavenly', 'Heavenly' or 'HEAVENLY'. Any punctuation that you enter will be ignored.
            </p>
            <h3>Selecting which authors to search</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Open the menu (click the menu button in the top left or scroll in from the left)</li>
                    <li>Click "Selected Authors"</li>
                    <li>Select all the authors you wish to search (Authors to be search will light up)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, click the 'Search' button and then, after a short time (depending on the speed of your device), the search results page will be displayed. The first search of a particular author will be slower than subsequent searches for the same author since the index needs to be loaded in the first search.
            </p>
            <p>
                Clicking on one of the references on the search results page will take you to that reference. The matched sentence/paragraph will be displayed at the top of your browser window.
            </p>
            <h3>Wildcards</h3>
            <h4>* at end</h4>
            <p>
                For example in: delight*
                <br> This will return all results that <strong>begin</strong> with delight eg: delight, delights, delightful, delighted and delighting
            </p>
            <h4>* at start</h4>
            <p>
                For example in: *ight
                <br> This will return all results that <strong>end</strong> with ight eg: sight, slight, delight, weight and height
            </p>
            <h4>* at start and end</h4>
            <p>
                For example in: *wait*
                <br> This will return all results that <strong>contain</strong> wait eg: wait, waited, waiting, waits, awaits, waiteth, awaiting, await, awaited and waiter
            </p>
            <p>
                Wildcard searches take considerably longer than normal searches.
            </p>
            <p>
                The type of search selected in the 'Search Type' menu will be ignored during a wildcard search.
            </p>
            <h3>Very Frequent Words</h3>
            <p>
                There are a number of words (about 200) that occur so frequently (more than 1000 times) in ministry that they have not been indexed (for example: 'a', 'all', 'am', 'and', 'any' and 'are'). If these are the only words that you enter in the search string then the search engine will return no matches.
